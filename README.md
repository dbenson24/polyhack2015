# Skeleton Life

This app allows you to create a skeleton to explore random areas of the world.
Given a Latitude and Longitude, your skeleton will seek a unique adventure of his own
thanks to the power of Google Maps and Trip Advisor's API.

If you decide that your skeleton had a particularly exciting journey, feel free
to share the link with all of your friends.
